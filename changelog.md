# Changelog

* Switched from `unittest` to `pytest` (more features with similar syntax)
* Finished up documentation on `DeconstructionPlanner`
* Patched InvalidModVersionError for now (#51)
* Added data functions `signals.add_signal()`, `tiles.add_tile()`, `entities.add_entity()`, etc.
* Made it so that default `collision_mask` keys are resolved at once at the data level when you call `draftsman-update`, so you can query `entities.raw` for the correct default value

## 1.0.3
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.76` (latest stable)
* Updated `compatibility/defines.lua` to `1.1.76` (latest stable)
* Merged penguincounter's pull request:
    * Fixed logistics requester and buffer chest signatures not having the correct `circuit_mode_of_operation` key
* Added a `dump_format()` method to entities that outputs a user friendly description of all of the possible key/value entries in the exported blueprint dict
    * Still needs to be done for Blueprintable; ideally there would be a `Exportable` parent class that would implement the madness
    * Also need to investigate faster validation options since schema is pretty slow; maybe we can unify and improve speed at the same time
* Added a `get_format()` method intended to get a readable formatted string (that can easily be autogenerated at the top of each entity in the documentation! Not yet but soon)
* Changed `_exports` dict to be both more user readable and only defined on a per class basis instead of a per instance basis (so memory usage should be down)
* Prepped `env.py` for when Lupa version 2.0 goes live (which will resolve #50)
* Fixed `"Mining_Drones_Harder"` mod not loading because of stray "__MACOSX" folder defined alongside (#55)
* Fixed `"FactorioExtended-Plus-Logistics"` not loading due to internal file titled `__init__.lua` (#56)
* Fixed `env.extract_entities().categorize_entities()` to `get` flags instead of assuming they exist (`"flags"` set is common but optional)

## 1.0.2
* Added `UpgradePlanner` and `DeconstructionPlanner` (#40)
* Created an abstract class `Blueprintable` which now implements `Blueprint`, `BlueprintBook`, `UpgradePlanner`, and `DeconstructionPlanner` to increase code reuse
* Added `description` attribute to `Blueprint` and `BlueprintBook` (#41)
* Changed the behavior of `draftsman-update` to normalize all mod names to have no spaces (probably not perfect, but should work for now) (#49)
* Added a `--path` argument to `draftsman-update` so you can specify exactly where to load mods from instead of only the installation directory (#49)
* Draftsman now distributes with a vanilla set of pickle data files, so you no longer need to run `draftsman-update` on first install (suggestion from rpdelaney)
* Rolling Stock (Locomotives and Wagons) should now have proper collisions that are based on their `orientation` and issue correct warnings (#47)
* Updated the documentation around `draftsman-update` to make it more clear and reflect recent changes
* Updated all `Blueprintable` documentation files such that they now include a plaintext representation of their JSON structure

## 1.0.1
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.65`
* Fixed #38 and #39

## 1.0.0
* Updated `factorio-data` to version `1.1.61`
* Added a `Vector` class to represent 2d positions, and changed most of the code to reflect this change
    * This is a breaking change, but it should be much more natural to access positions by attribute `x` and `y` instead of `["x"]` and `["y"]`
    * By specifying a class like this, custom operators are allowed such as vector math, which means that offsetting positions and other operations have become much easier as a result
    * `Vector` has a static member function `from_other()` that constructs a `Vector` object from all valid formats accepted in the past (`tuple`, `dict`, `list`, etc.) which is used in all standard functions, so you shouldn't have to change any of their signatures
    * `Vector` also has a `to_dict()` method to turn it back into it's dictionary format for exporting (`{"x": ..., "y": ...}`)
    * The `Vector` class is only used on the "outermost" layer due to performance reasons, internally the most common representation is still `list[float, float]`
* Added an abstract `Shape` class, along with two implementations: `AABB` and `Rectangle`
    * `AABB` and `Rectangle` are now used for issuing `OverlappingObjectWarning` 
* All functions that used to use `Sequences` or `list[list[float], list[float]]` have been changed to `Vector` and `AABB` respectively for user clarity
* Added another class: `CollisionSet`, which is a list of `Shapes` used for checking if two `Entity`s intersect one another
    * This was needed because curved rails have 2 collision boxes instead of a single one
    * Collision sets also support rotations, which means that rotations are automatically generated or specified manually for edge cases like rails
    * In essence, `CollisionSets` provide more flexibility for entity footprints on a per-entity-type (or even per-entity) level
* Added `find_entity_at_position()` so you can simply check for any entity in particular at a position instead of having to use fully-blown `find_entities_filtered` or the more-specific `find_entity()` function
* Abstracted `SpatialHashMap` to be an implementation of abstract class `SpatialDataStructure`, which will allow for different implementations such as quadtrees or other algorithms if they happen to be more performant than hash-mapping (For now all `Collections` still use `SpatialHashMap` though)
* Renamed `entity_hashmap` and `tile_hashmap` to more generic `entity_map` and `tile_map` to reflect the above change
* Move almost all entity insert/set/remove logic to `EntityCollection.on_entity_insert`, `on_entity_set`, and `on_entity_remove`, which gets called from `EntityList.insert` and related 
* Added `on_tile_insert`, `on_tile_set`, and `on_tile_remove` to `TileCollection` to mirror the changes to `EntityCollection`
* Added `copy` keyword to `TileList.insert` and `TileList.append` to mirror `EntityList.insert` and `EntityList.append`
* Added Entity/Tile merging
  * Added `merge` keyword to both `EntityList.insert/append` and `TileList.insert/append`
  * Attempting to use `merge=True` keywords and `copy=False` will result in a `ValueError`, as this behavior is loosely defined (for now at least)
* Rails now properly issue `OverlappingObjectsWarnings`; Rails can overlap each other provided they don't have the exact same position + direction + type
* Another big documentation pass
* Split the `signatures.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR` into many sub implementations, which should improve both safety and (hopefully) performance
* Fixed #24, #25, #27, #32, #33, and #34

## 0.9.7
* Merged louga31's pull request
    * Rewrite of the `_shift_key_indices` in `EntityList` to make it faster using list comprehension
* Merged elswindle's pull request
    * Moved conversion of associations from `Blueprint.load_from_string` to `Blueprint.setup` so they always take place
    * Fixed `UndergroundBelt` `io_type` attribute not reading correctly from key `type`
    * Changed test case to account for this
* Added `DirectionalMixin` to `AssemblingMachine` (as technically it can have it in select circumstances)
* Fixed load conflict between `items` and `recipe` in `AssemblingMachine` (#23)
* Fixed `setup.py` so that it properly requires `typing_extensions` on versions of Python prior to 3.8 (#30)

* Fixed an issue where `BlueprintBook` icons were not properly set and issued an incorrect warning (#31)

## 0.9.6
* Merged sposker's pull request
    * Fixed an bug where `IndexError` would be triggered on setting the final item filter slot
    * Updated `signatures.CONTROL_BEHAVIOR` to include the `send_to_train` key
* Merged elswindle's pull request
    * Dictionary Blueprints and BlueprintBook's are now properly converted to `Blueprint` and `BlueprintBook` objects when added to a `BlueprintableList`
* Fixed documentation for `FilterMixin.set_item_filters` that labeled `"name"` key as `"signal"`
* Made docs for `FilterMixin.set_item_filters` and `FilterMixin.set_item_filter` more clear
* Changed `signals.raw` to actually be the extraction from `data.raw` so people can query the order strings and other information (#17)
* Sorted `signals.raw` according to signal-processing order (virtual -> fluid -> item) instead of item sort order (#17)
* Added `signals.type_of` as a more specific structure to fulfill the old functionality of `signals.raw` (#17)
* Changed the functionality of `ConstantCombinator` so that attempting to set one of it's signals to a pure virtual signal results in a `DraftsmanWarning` (because for some grotesque reason Factorio actually allows this)
* Renamed `InvalidConnectionError` to more general `InvalidAssociationError` and updated documentation
* Removed requirement for `Groups` to have an ID associated with it (this was required in the past, but is no longer necessary)
* Fixed unable to find connectable entities when calling `Blueprint.generate_power_connections()` on blueprint that contained `Groups` (#19)
* Added the capability to specify connections based on entity reference as well instead of just ID or index (`[add/remove]_power_connection`, `[add/remove]_circuit_connection`) (#19)
    * Made these functions issue `InvalidAssociationError` when attempting to connect two entities that lie outside of the `EntityCollection`
    * Added recursive `__contains__` function to `EntityList` to facilitate the above
* Fixed copying of entities between `Blueprints` and `Groups` (#20)
* Added capability to deepcopy `Entities`, `Groups`, and `Blueprints`, with appropriate errors
* Added capability to set the `entities` of a `Blueprint` or `Group` to another `Blueprints` or `Groups` `entities` (#16)
* Added optional `string` keyword for the constructor of `Group` so you can import a blueprint string directly into a group instead of having to create a "scratch" `Blueprint`

## 0.9.5
* Added `keywords` to `setup.py`
* Added `__contains__` function to `Blueprint` (I thought it was inferred from `__getitem__`, whoops) (#14)
* Added `defines.lua` as a more comprehensive solution to the Factorio `defines` issue (#15)
* Added distinguishing between multiple versions of the same mod; the latest mod is always preferred, with warnings for duplicates issued (#15)
* Started work on `RailPlanner`
* Other minor documentation changes
* Fixed the old repo link in `setup.py`
* Fixed #13:
    * Implemented the functionality according to the game, preserving Factorio safety

    * Updated documentation to reflect these changes
* Moved initialization of `Blueprint.area` attribute before loading entities in `Blueprint.setup()` (#14)

## 0.9.4
* Added the capability to display any logged messages to during `draftsman-update` with the command line argument `-l` or `--log`
* Added `prep.py` to prepare releases more automatically so I don't miss steps like a fool (maybe I'll integrate something like poetry in the future)
* Updated `env.py` to create the `factorio-mods` folder if it doesn't exist, in case the user accidentally deleted it
* Updated `env.py` so that everything is now sorted (mostly) properly
* Updated readme to point to related Alt-F4 article
* Updated `requirements.txt` to include `build` for development
* Changed the manner in which sort items are searched in `env.py` (related to issue #9)
* Changed the manner in which the order of items are determined so there's less redundancy
* Changed `normalize_module_name` from non-digit characters to alphanumeric characters (duh!) (#11)
* Changed `normalize_module_name` to distinguish between "slash" paths and "dot" paths and only convert "dot" paths if found (#11)
* Added more duct tape to the local file requiring issue machine (#11)
* Removed `temp.py` from GitHub distribution, it was only really intended as scrap paper for me
* Fixed #10
* Fixed #12

## 0.9.3
* Fixed #9

## 0.9.2
* Added `signals` attribute to `ConstantCombinator`, which aliases `control_behavior["filters"]`
* (Re)Added circuit attributes back to `ArithmeticCombinator` and `DeciderCombinator`
* Minor docs fixes
* Bugfix: resolved #6
* Bugfix: resolved #8 (At least for now, current behavior should be more predictable)

## 0.9.1
* Updated `factorio-data` to `1.1.58`
* Added description of `control_behavior` attribute structure to `docs/source` folder
* Added read-only `global_position` property to `SpatialLike`; allows for efficient querying of an objects root-most position

* Integrated `entities.flippable` into `Entity` class, as well as `Transformable`
* Updated `tox.ini` to use `--no-mods` on `draftsman-update`
* Reworked `SpatialHashMap` and `get_area` to use `global_position` instead of `position`
* Reworked `RequestItemsMixin` and added it to more prototypes
* Split `ModuleSlotsMixin` from `RequestItemsMixin` to compartmentalize more
* Adding science pack item requests to a `Lab` no longer raises a warning (works with any lab)
* Made `set_x_filter` code more consistent across different prototype filter types
* Added folder loading to `draftsman-update`
* Documentation format fixes/additions
* Bugfix: Fixed the local paths that now point from `factorio-draftsman` instead of `factorio-draftsman/draftsman` in `draftsman-update` for folders
* Bugfix: Changed Lua file requiring so that it makes (somewhat) more sense; Honestly the whole thing is pretty fricking scuffed, and needs a redo
* Bugfix: Fixed `OverlappingObjectsWarning` occurring when placing two groups with the same local coordinates but different global coordinates in an `EntityCollection`
* Bugfix: Fixed Maximum recursion depth errors when running `examples/item_stack_signals.py` with large modpacks with many items; this should no longer occur period
* Bugfix: Split `index_dict` in `env.extract_items` to `group_index_dict` and `subgroup_index_dict`
* Bugfix: Encapsulated `order` swapping in `env.get_order` with a `try except` block

## **0.3.5.1**
* Changed ALL of the setters to use properties because I didn't know Python properties _existed_

* Split all of the entity definitions into their own file (much clearer)
* Added `image_converter.py` example
