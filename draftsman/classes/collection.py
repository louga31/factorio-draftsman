        **criteria**:

        .. list-table:: Region keywords
            :header-rows: 1

            * - Name
              - Type
              - Description
            * - ``position``
              - ``Vector`` or ``PrimitiveVector``
              - Grid position to search.
            * - ``radius``
              - ``float``
              - Radius of the circle around position to search.
            * - ``area``
              - ``AABB`` or ``PrimitiveAABB``
              - AABB to search in.

        If none of the above are specified, then the search area becomes the 
        entire Collection. If ``radius`` is specified but ``position`` is not,
        the search area also becomes the entire Collection.

            type of an entity to be returned.

            ``int``), or a ``set[Direction]`` where each entry is a valid

        Adds a copper wire power connection between two entities. Each entity
        can be either a reference to the original entity to connect, the index
        of the entity in the ``entities`` list, or it's string ID. Tuples of
        strings and ints mean to recursively search through
        :py:class:`EntityCollection` instances in the base level, following the
        logic of :py:meth:`.EntityList.__getitem__`. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            blueprint.entities.append("small-electric-pole")
            group = Group("group") # Type of EntityCollection

            # in the group
            blueprint.add_power_connection(blueprint.entities[0], ("group", 0))

        Side specifies which side to connect to when establishing a
        connection to a dual-power-connectable entity (usually a power-switch).
        Does nothing if the connection already exists.

        Raises :py:class:`~draftsman.warning.ConnectionRangeWarning` if the
        distance between the two entities exceeds the maximum wire distance
        between the two.

        Raises :py:class:`~draftsman.warning.TooManyConnectionsWarning` if
        either of the power poles exceed 5 connections when this connection is
        added.

        .. NOTE::

            ``side`` is in 1-based notation (1 and 2, input and output) which is
            identical to circuit connections. Internally, however, the
            connections are represented in 0-based notation as "Cu0" and "Cu1"
            respectively.

        .. NOTE::

            You might notice that unlike :py:meth:`add_circuit_connection`,
            there is only one ``side`` argument. This is because it is actually
            impossible to connect two dual-power-connectable entities with one
            another; they must be connected to a power pole in-between.

        :param entity_1: EntityLike, ID, or index of the first entity to join.

        Finds a set of trains that match the passed in parameters. Formally, a 
        "train" is a connected set of wagons consisting of at least one 
        locomotive. Since blueprint strings contain no information regarding
        train-connectivity, train connections are inferred from their relative
        ``position`` and ``orientation``.

        .. NOTE:

            When using the ``config`` parameter, equality is strictly checked;
            which means that if a returned train doesn't _exactly_ match the 
            specified argument, the train is filtered from the result. This 
            includes things like item fuel requests and cargo wagon item filters, 
            so check these values in the blueprints you're searching and adjust
            ``config`` accordingly.

        :param train_length: Can either be specified as an ``int`` representing
            the maximum length of trains to return (inclusive), or as a 
            ``Sequence`` of 2 ``int``s representing the minimum and maximum 
            length of trains to return (inclusive).
        :param num_type: A ``dict`` of wagon types where each key is the ``str``
            type of the wagon and the value is an ``int`` representing the
            desired number of those wagons in the returned train. Allows to
            search for trains of a particular composition without regards to
            contents, order, or orientation.
        :param orientation: A :py:class:`Orientation` (or equivalent ``float``)
            that describes the orientation that every car in the returned train
            list should have. Note that trains placed on curved rails will not
            be returned by this parameter, as _all_ train cars must equal 
            ``orientation``.
        :param config: A :py:class:`TrainConfiguration` object to filter against.
            Performs a strict equality check between each of the train 
            configuration's cars and the cars in the returned trains.
        :param invert: Whether or not to return the inversion of the search
            criteria.
        :param limit: A maximum number of unique trains to return. 

        :returns: A ``list`` of ``list``s, where each sub-list represents a 
            contiguous train. Trains are ordered such that the first index is 
            the "front" of the train as chosen by the orientation of the first
